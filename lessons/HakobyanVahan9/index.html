			The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b><abbr>HTML</abbr></b> is the standard <a href="#">markup language</a> for documents 
			designed to be displayed in a <a href="#">web browser</a>. It can be assisted by<br> technologies such 
			as <a href="#">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) and <a href="#">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="#">JavaScript</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="#">Web browsers</a> receive <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents from a <a href="#">Web server</a> or from local storage and 
			<a href="#">render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. <abbr>HTML</abbr> describes the<br> structure of a 
			<a href="#">web page semantically </a>and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="#"><abbr>HTML</abbr> elements</a> are the building blocks of <abbr>HTML</abbr> pages. With <abbr>HTML</abbr> constructs, <a href="#">images</a>images and other objects
			such as <a href="#">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the<br> rendered page. <abbr>HTML</abbr> provides a means to create 
			<a href="#">structured documents</a> by denoting structural <a href="#">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
			<a href="#">links</a>,<br> quotes, and other items. <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements are delineated by tags, written using <a href="#">angle brackets</a>. 
			Tags such as <span <span style="background-color:#f8f8f8; border:1px solid #eaecf0; color:#008000;">&lt;img /&gt;</span> and 
			<span <span style="background-color:#f8f8f8; border:1px solid #eaecf0; color:#008000;">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce content<br> into the page. 
			Other tags such as <span style="background-color:#f8f8f8; border:1px solid #eaecf0; color:#008000;">&lt;p&gt;</span> 
			surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers
			do not <br> display the <abbr>HTML</abbr> tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			<abbr>HTML</abbr> can embed programs written in a <a href="#"> scripting language </a> such as <a href="#">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior 
			and content of web pages. The inclusion of <abbr>CSS</abbr> defines <br>the look and layout of content. </a> The <a href="#"> World Wide 
			Web Consortium</a> (W3C), former maintainer of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> and current maintainer of the <abbr>CSS</abbr> standards, has<br>
			encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational <abbr>HTML</abbr> since 1997. A form of HTML, known as </a> <a href="#">HTML5</a> 
			is used to display video and audio, primarily using<br> the <span style="background-color:#f8f8f8; border:1px solid #eaecf0; color:#008000;">&lt;canvas/&gt;</span> element, in collaboration with javascript.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>
			In 1980, <a href="#">physicist Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at <a href="#">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="#">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for
			CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-<br>Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="#">Internet</a>-based 
			<a href="#">hypertext</a> system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
			That year, Berners-Lee <br>and CERN <a href="#">data systems</a> engineer <a href="#">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for 
			funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 <br>he listed
			"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an <a href="#">encyclopedia</a> first.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first publicly available description of <abbr>HTML</abbr> was a document called <a href="#">"<abbr>HTML</abbr> Tags"</a>, first mentioned on the Internet
			by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements <br> comprising the initial, relatively simple design of 
			<abbr>HTML</abbr>. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by <a href="#">SGMLguid</a>, an in-house <a href="#">Standard Generalized Markup<br>
			Language</a> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.
		</p>
		<p>
			<abbr>HTML</abbr>HTML is a <a href="#">markup language</a> that <a href="#">web browsers</a> use to interpret and <a href="#">compose</a> text, images, and other material into visual 
			or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every <br> item of <abbr>HTML</abbr> markup are defined in the browser, and these 
			characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href="#"><abbr>CSS</abbr></a>. Many of the text elements 
			are <br> found in the 1988 <abbr>ISO</abbr> technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using <abbr>SGML</abbr>, which in turn covers the features of early 
			text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href="#">RUNOFF command</a> <br> developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="#">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) 
			operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually <br> format documents. However, 
			the <abbr>SGML</abbr> concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, 
			with also the separation of <br>structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with <abbr>CSS</abbr>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Berners-Lee considered <abbr>HTML</abbr> to be an application of <abbr>SGML</abbr>. It was formally defined as such by the <a href="#">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>
			(<abbr>IETF</abbr>) with the mid-1993 publication of the <br> first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" 
			Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and <a href="#">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an <abbr>SGML</abbr> <a href="#">Document type definition</a><br> to define the grammar. The draft 
			expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the <a href="#"><abbr>NCSA</abbr> Mosaic</a> browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
			reflecting the <abbr>IETF</abbr>'s <br> philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, <a href="#">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet-Draft, 
			"<abbr>HTML</abbr>+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing <br> already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>HTML</abbr>+ drafts expired in early 1994, the <abbr>IETF</abbr> created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "<abbr>HTML</abbr> 2.0",
			the first <abbr>HTML</abbr> specification intended to be <br> treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further development under the auspices of the <abbr>IETF</abbr> was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the <abbr>HTML</abbr> specifications have been maintained,
			with input from commercial software <br> vendors, by the <a href="#">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). However, in 2000, <abbr>HTML</abbr> also became an international 
			standard (<abbr><a href="#">ISO</a></abbr>/<abbr><a href="#">IEC</a></abbr> 15445:2000). <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.01 was published in late 1999,<br> with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on 
			<abbr>HTML</abbr>5 in the <a href="#">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG), which became a joint <br> deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed
			and standardized on 28 October 2014.
