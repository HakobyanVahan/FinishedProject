		<h2>Lorem ipsum text</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
			industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
			text ever since the<i style="color:green"> 1500s</i>, when an unknown printer took a 
			galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
			It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
			electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
			popularised in the <span style="color:yellow">1960</span>s with the release of Letraset sheets 
			containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
			publishing software like <u>Aldus PageMaker</u> including versions of 
			Lorem Ipsum.
